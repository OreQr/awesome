# Contributing

We'd love to have your project listed here!

If your project meets least one of these criteria:

- has over 10 stars
- been downloaded more than 250 times
- or other official metrics (such as visit count) that's considerable

... then look no further on adding it here!

## How to add

To add an entry, clone the repository or go to the
[README.md](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust/blob/main/README.md) file
and click on the pen-like button in the upper-right corner to make your changes and
then create a pull-request.

Please make sure that your entry:

- is in the appropriate language and category
- is placed in alphabetical order
- - Note: if you think that no existing category suits your project, feel free to
    suggest one.
- uses the following template: `[project name](https://github.com/account/repository) - description`
- and that the linked repository contains a proper readme file.

## Other suggestions

If you think that something could be improved, or you spot a mistake, feel free to
make an issue or a pull request to discuss about it.

## Removal of projects

Entries aren't usually removed.
